          <p>Respecting boundaries ensure healthy relationships.<br>
            This is a heart-felt note to my present and future clients. In order for a productive and effective health coaching experience to exist, it is imperative for the client to ALWAYS take responsibility for:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Making timely payments before sessions happen.</li>
            <li>Show up for sessions on time.</li>
            <li>Not demand changes to their plans if they simply do not like whats assigned.</li>
            <li>NOT call without making an appointment with the health coach before the next session.</li>
            <li>Have a proactive attitude about making the changes needed in order to reach their health goals.</li>
            <li>Talk Respectfully to the health coach at all times.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The health coach is not in anyway obligated to the client to make changes to the plan once it is made. <br>
            The health coach has the right to refuse coaching the client if any of these boundaries are crossed, and will terminate the program immediately. <br>
            Health coaching is an investment in yourself.  Following these boundaries will ensure a pleasant and fruitful experience for the client and coach alike. <br>
            Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to collaborating with you on your journey to “Being-Well.” <br>
            Sonia Salim. </p>
